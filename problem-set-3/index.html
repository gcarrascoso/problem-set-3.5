        <p style ="color:#27775f;"> As you all may be aware, Fortnite is
          arguably one of the most popular videogames on the market, and one of the

          Fortnite's <strong>Emotes</strong>, little dances or poses a player can
          make thier character perform.  Fortnite Emotes are a culmination of some
          of the most influencial and iconic dances in recent pop culture, and this
          will evaluate some of the top emotes that can make any individual want to
          bust a move.

            which ones were to be showcased, we devised a system based on 3 main
            principles in which a solid emote is built upon. </p>
