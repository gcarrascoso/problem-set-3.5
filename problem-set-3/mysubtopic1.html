        <div align ="center">
          <p style ="color:#27775f;"> This classic emote is based off of the

          <p style ="color:#27775f;"> This emote is quite a groovy one, with
            smooth and fluid motions.  The goofiness of this dance fits in perfectly

          <p style ="color:#27775f;"> Based off the Russian folk dance, this
            emote takes real balance and coordination to perform in real life.
            It is definitely one that would impress many when executed making for
            a very memorable emote. </p>
      <h4 style ="color:#27775f;">5. Take The L</h4>
        <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2AJ3feqTn1w/maxresdefault.jpg" height="180" width="320" />
          <p style ="color:#27775f;"> A fan favorite, the Take The L emote is
            possibly the most direspectful emote to perform after beating your
            opponent.  Seeing the dance after loosing can make on very salty.
      <h4 style ="color:#27775f;">4. Best Mates</h4>
        <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KSeiXnobx5A/maxresdefault.jpg" height="180" width="320" />
          <p style ="color:#27775f;"> Based off of a viral vine by the social media
            influencer, Marlon Webb, Best Mates is a very fun dance in fortnite
            and in real life.  It makes you want to grab a group of pals and dance
            in the streets. </p>
      <h4 style ="color:#27775f;">3. Orance Justice</h4>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTYav8W7H2zjR3Mwxko-fWnFsvJ_jOam9v5s2JxL76Wgr8F6aXH" height="180" width="320" />
          <p style ="color:#27775f;"> Popularized by figures such as Roy Purdy,
            Orange Justice can make anyone crack up when seeing being performed
            in public.  It perfectly blends comedic actions, and technical dance
            skill.  It is also a popular emote to do amongst younger kids.
      <h4 style ="color:#27775f;">2. Electro Shuffle</h4>
        <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gdRfqbjoYQw/maxresdefault.jpg" height="180" width="320" />
          <p style ="color:#27775f;"> This emote has to be one of if not the
            most technically challenging.  Based off of a youtube video called
            'Bad and Boujee Shuffle Shapes,' the dance includes very fancy footwork
            for a very cool emote.

          <p style ="color:#27775f;"> Number 1 on our list just had to be the
            default emote.  It is the first one anyone gets in the game and is
            the most iconic.  the dance is from the television series Scrubs, and
            the background music that comes with the emote makes anyone want to
            attempt the dance!  Overall, this emote is by far the greatest.
